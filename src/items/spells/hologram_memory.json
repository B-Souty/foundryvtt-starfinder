The hologram memory can be no longer than 1 minute; if the extracted memory is longer than this, the hologram simply ends. The hologram includes audio as well as visual components, but it does not contain haptic, olfactory, or other components. The hologram typically plays a memory that takes place in a single scene, though it can cut to multiple scenes, if they are accurate to the memory and its length allows. The hologram plays the memory exactly as the target experienced it and from the target&rsquo;s perspective, so it often lacks context. The target creature must remain quiet and still while the hologram plays or the spell and hologram end.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This spell can target any living, unconscious, or deceased sentient creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher (or a modifier of &ndash;4 or higher).
