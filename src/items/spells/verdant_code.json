      "value": "<p>You turn data into plant matter that either instantly explodes outward or lurks within a device.<br><strong>Instant Growth:&nbsp;</strong>You immediately incite growth from the targeted device. A creature can negate the effect on an object it holds with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. For both this and the dormant growth effect (see below), the plant matter explodes from the targeted device, filling all squares within a 20-foot-radius spread. Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes 5d6 slashing damage and is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled}; on a successful save, it takes half damage, isn\u2019t @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nFBcsp5FS1Wi46Fc]{Entangled}, and is shunted to the nearest empty space available. A square of plant matter has hardness 8 and 15 Hit Points. The growth also covers the device, preventing non-remote access until the plant matter is destroyed or disintegrates at the end of the spell\u2019s duration.<br><strong>Dormant Growth:&nbsp;</strong>You implant verdant code into an computer system or module you have root access to. The next time the device is accessed, plant matter explodes from the device (see above). A device can hold only one instance of verdant code at a time, and new instances erase the previous instance. If this spell\u2019s duration ends before the implanted code is accessed, the code vanishes. This code can be made permanent, as&nbsp;implant data.</p>"
