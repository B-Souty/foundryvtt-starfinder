You must also target an entire body of fluid, rather than only part of it.

In so doing, the reverting fluid cannot cause harm.&nbsp;</span></p>", "unidentified": ""}, "source": "COM pg. 134", "type": "", "activation": {"type": "action", "cost": 1, "condition": ""}, "duration": {"value": "instantaneous", "units": ""}, "target": {"value": "one creature", "type": ""}, "area": {"value": null, "units": "none", "shape": "", "effect": ""}, "range": {"value": 25, "units": "ft", "additional": "5 ft.", "per": "2 levels"}, "uses": {"value": null, "max": null, "per": ""}, "isActive": null, "ability": "", "actionType": "", "attackBonus": 0, "chatFlavor": "", "rollNotes": "", "damageNotes": "", "critical": {"parts": [], "effect": ""}, "damage": {"parts": []}, "formula": "", "save": {"type": "will", "dc": null, "descriptor": "negate"}, "descriptors": [], "modifiers": [], "level": 0, "school": "con", "sr": false, "dismissible": false, "concentration": false, "materials": {"value": "", "consumed": false, "cost": 0, "supply": 0}, "preparation": {"mode": "", "prepared": false}, "allowedClasses": {"myst": false, "tech": false, "wysh": true}, "isVariableLevel": false, "abilityMods": {"parts": []}}, "effects": [], "flags": {"core": {"sourceId": "Compendium.sfrpg.spells.KaIbA9BCQfEagPsO"}}, "_id": "KaIbA9BCQfEagPsO"}
