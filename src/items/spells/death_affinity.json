This immunity does not apply to such effects currently affecting the creature. The creature also gains a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against the following effects: mind-affecting, paralysis, and stunning effects; ability damage; ability drain; and any effect that requires a Fortitude saving throw (unless the effect works on objects or is harmless).<br />For effects that target creatures by type, the target creature counts as both its own type and undead (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types).<br />When the spell ends, the above effects end and the target gains the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.33ynSbmexuxC3cAQ]{Exhausted} condition.</span></p>"
