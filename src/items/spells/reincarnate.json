      "value": "<p>When you cast this spell, you bring back a @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead} creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the target\u2019s soul is free and willing to return. If the target\u2019s soul is not willing to return, the spell fails; therefore, a target that wants to return receives no saving throw. Casting this spell requires a special monument worth at least 1,000 credits to serve as a beacon for the departed creature\u2019s soul. This object is consumed when you cast the spell.<br><br>Since the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.nEJIWMKbPjqKuelo]{Dead} creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and @Compendium[sfrpg.rules.JaRMioj4isNp7r1P]{Afflictions} are removed. The condition of the creature\u2019s remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature\u2019s body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature\u2019s body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the target is reincarnated.<br><br>A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class features, feats, and skill ranks it formerly had. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and Hit Points are unchanged. The creature should recalculate its ability scores from scratch as a member of its new race (remembering to include any ability score increases from leveling up). The target of the spell gains 2 permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the target is 1st level, it takes 2 Constitution drain instead (if the Constitution drain would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less, the creature cannot be reincarnated). The target creature can decide whether its new body retains any of the implants it had in its former body. A spellcasting creature has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.<br><br>For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the facing page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.<br><br>Elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can\u2019t be reincarnated. Any creature that can\u2019t benefit from the&nbsp;mystic cure&nbsp;spell cannot be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.<br><br>The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including any forms of movement and speeds, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it does not automatically speak the language of the new form it takes.<br><br></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>D%</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Incarnation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1\u20136</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.GHIntVN70xTt2Tlo]{Android}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">7\u201314</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.SaWDXnfaX24Iuuuz]{Dwarf}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">15\u201322</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.K7OFZY7hnnKZQ8YY]{Elf}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">23\u201330</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.5uBvbTEiUu1ckQwk]{Gnome}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">31\u201334</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.5WhPSrWQWwWNLvtj]{Half-elf}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">35\u201338</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.hRuWhbQgSFVA12NS]{Half-orc}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">39\u201346</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.XVyIJzuDyZ4FkmCf]{Halfling}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">47\u201355</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.AMBcyDZDtJ1OOzh3]{Human}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">56\u201364</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Lashunta</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">65\u201373</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.dGlSCMtFZ2ZIKUpl]{Kasatha}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">74\u201381</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.VIJ6pdOVTJle3vJx]{Shirren}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">82\u201390</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Vesk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">91\u201399</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">@Compendium[sfrpg.races.PWjnNkCCW5diAQU4]{Ysoki}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Other (GM\u2019s choice)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br>A&nbsp;miracle&nbsp;or&nbsp;wish&nbsp;spell can restore a reincarnated creature to its original form.</p>"
