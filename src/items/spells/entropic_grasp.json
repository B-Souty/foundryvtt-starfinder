If the item is so large that it can’t fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-foot-radius volume of the material is destroyed. This is an instantaneous effect.<br><br>You can employ&nbsp;entropic grasp&nbsp;in combat by making a melee attack against your opponent’s EAC. If you hit, you instantaneously reduce a manufactured armor’s KAC and EAC bonus by 3 (to a minimum of a +0 bonus). Damaged armor can be repaired using the Engineering skill; with a successful check, the armor’s armor bonuses are restored to their original values. Against a manufactured creature (generally constructs, but not undead), this attack instead deals 6d12 damage.<br><br>Weapons and equipment in use by an opponent are more difficult to affect with this spell. You attempt a sunder combat maneuver against the item. If successful, you deal 6d6 damage to the weapon or item.<br><br>Used in combat, this spell lasts 1 round per level, and you can make one melee attack each round on future rounds as a standard action. The target can attempt a save to negate each melee attack, but success does not end the spell.<br><br>Casting this spell doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>"
