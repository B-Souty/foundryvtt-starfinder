If the item is so large that it can&rsquo;t fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-foot-radius volume of the material is destroyed. This is an instantaneous effect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can employ entropic grasp in combat by making a melee attack against your opponent&rsquo;s EAC. If you hit, you instantaneously reduce a manufactured armor&rsquo;s KAC and EAC bonus by 3 (to a minimum of a +0 bonus). Damaged armor can be repaired using the Engineering skill; with a successful check, the armor&rsquo;s armor bonuses are restored to their original values. Against a manufactured creature (generally constructs, but not undead), this attack instead deals 6d12 damage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Weapons and equipment in use by an opponent are more difficult to affect with this spell. You attempt a sunder combat maneuver against the item. If successful, you deal 6d6 damage to the weapon or item.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Used in combat, this spell lasts 1 round per level, and you can make one melee attack each round on future rounds as a standard action. The target can attempt a save to negate each melee attack, but success does not end the spell.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Casting this spell doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>", "unidentified": ""}, "source": "CRB pg. 353", "type": "", "activation": {"type": "action", "cost": 1, "condition": ""}, "duration": {"value": "see text", "units": ""}, "target": {"value": "One nonmagical manufactured object (or the volume of the object within a 3 ft. radium of the touched point) or one manufactured creature touched each round", "type": ""}, "area": {"value": null, "units": "none", "shape": "", "effect": ""}, "range": {"value": null, "units": "touch", "additional": "", "per": ""}, "uses": {"value": null, "max": null, "per": ""}, "isActive": null, "ability": "str", "actionType": "msak", "attackBonus": 0, "chatFlavor": "", "rollNotes": "", "damageNotes": "", "critical": {"parts": [], "effect": ""}, "damage": {"parts": [{"formula": "6d12", "types": {"acid": false, "cold": false, "electricity": false, "fire": false, "sonic": false, "bludgeoning": false, "piercing": false, "slashing": false, "healing": false}, "operator": ""}, {"formula": "6d6", "types": {"acid": false, "cold": false, "electricity": false, "fire": false, "sonic": false, "bludgeoning": false, "piercing": false, "slashing": false, "healing": false}, "operator": ""}]}, "formula": "", "save": {"type": "fort", "dc": "", "descriptor": "object"}, "descriptors": [], "modifiers": [], "level": 3, "school": "trs", "sr": false, "dismissible": false, "concentration": false, "materials": {"value": "", "consumed": false, "cost": 0, "supply": 0}, "preparation": {"mode": "", "prepared": false}, "allowedClasses": {"myst": false, "tech": true, "wysh": true}, "isVariableLevel": false, "abilityMods": {"parts": []}}, "effects": [], "flags": {"core": {"sourceId": "Compendium.sfrpg.spells.WdVuZELNzMaNqE6j"}}, "_id": "WdVuZELNzMaNqE6j"}
