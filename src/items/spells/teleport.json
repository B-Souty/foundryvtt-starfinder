      "value": "<p>This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination within 2,000 miles. Interplanar and interplanetary travel is not possible, and neither is travel between two moving starships during combat, though you might be able to teleport to a planet\u2019s surface from an orbiting starship. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn\u2019t exceed your maximum bulk limit. You can also bring up to five additional willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or their equivalent. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, and a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As the caster, you need not attempt a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use by another creature receive saving throws and benefit from spell resistance.<br><br>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult Table 10\u20131. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.<br><br><strong>Familiarity:</strong> \u201cVery familiar\u201d describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. \u201cStudied carefully\u201d describes a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or because you\u2019ve been there often. \u201cSeen casually\u201d describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. \u201cViewed once\u201d describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic, remote cameras, or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location, you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can\u2019t teleport to an unknown location that you\u2019ve seen in a holovid).<br><br>\u201cFalse destination\u201d describes a place that doesn\u2019t truly exist, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location, it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.<br><br><strong>On Target:</strong> You appear where you want to be.<br><br><strong>Off Target:</strong> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.<br><br><strong>Similar Area:</strong> You wind up in an area that\u2019s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell\u2019s range, the spell simply fails instead.<br><br><strong>Mishap:</strong> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten \u201cscrambled.\u201d You each take 2d10 damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time \u201cmishap\u201d comes up, the creatures take more damage and must reroll.<br><br></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Familiarity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\"><strong>On Target</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Off Target</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Similar Area</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Mishap</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Very familiar</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1\u201397</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">98\u201399</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Studied carefully</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1\u201394</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">95\u201397</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">98\u201399</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Seen casually</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1\u201388</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">89\u201394</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">95\u201398</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">99\u2013100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Viewed once</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1\u201376</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">77\u201388</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">89\u201396</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">97\u2013100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">False destination</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">\u2014</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">81\u201392</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">93\u2013100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
