The specific effect depends on the purpose for which the seed was bioengineered.&nbsp;Vital seeds&nbsp;can grow livestock and plants, replace missing organs, and perform many other useful tasks. Some common vital seeds are listed here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>As a standard action, you can squeeze a&nbsp;zeolite vital seed&nbsp;and place it on the ground or throw it (range 20 feet). A crystalline structure grows from the seed instantaneously, creating difficult terrain in its square. The structure absorbs radiation in its square and all adjacent squares, and it diminishes the severity of radiation within 30 feet of it by one step. Creatures in the area the&nbsp;zeolite vital seed&nbsp;affects gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against radiation sickness.</strong></p>",
