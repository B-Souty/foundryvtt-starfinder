      "value": "<p>Forbidden from venturing to the Sepres VI&rsquo;s surface due both to the cultural taboo against doing so and the very real risks associated with it, seprevois&mdash;especially members and sympathizers of the Returners&mdash;created these handheld devices to remotely explore their planet&rsquo;s surface. The surveyor features a small dish that transmits and receives a signal to the target, as well as a view screen and speaker that relay the device&rsquo;s findings to you. The device allows you to employ both the audio and visual versions of clairaudience/clairvoyance simultaneously at a planetary range once per day, for a maximum duration of 10 minutes.</p>",
