Clothing is often worn both under and over armor, and its benefits apply in nearly all situations. Clothing comes in several varieties based upon its intended purpose, as described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A travel outfit offers additional comfort and support during overland travel. You add 2 miles per 8-hour day of overland movement while wearing a traveling outfit. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Constitution checks to avoid taking nonlethal damage resulting from a forced march. See Overland Movement on page 258 for more details.</strong></p>",
