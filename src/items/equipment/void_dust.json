      "value": "<p>This powder looks like shimmering iron filings, but&nbsp;void dust&nbsp;is actually nanotech infused with magic antithetical to force effects. As a standard action, you can sprinkle the dust on something within your reach. When you sprinkle the dust on a magical force effect or a personal force field, roll 1d20 + 10 against a DC equal to 11 + the level of the caster or the item that created the force effect. If you succeed, the targeted effect is disrupted. A magical effect either ends, or, if it&rsquo;s permanent or ongoing, is suppressed for 10 minutes. A personal force field is suppressed for 10 minutes. If you fail, the targeted effect is suppressed for 1 round. The time spent suppressed counts against an effect&rsquo;s duration, and an item that uses battery charges still consumes those charges while suppressed.<br /><br />Void dust&nbsp;is sold by the pinch. One pinch affects only one force effect, and the pinch is consumed whether you succeed or fail. This dust isn&rsquo;t strong enough to affect starship force fields or force effects of a similar scale.</p>",
