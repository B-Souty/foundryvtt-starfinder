In general, you can find accommodations at half to one-quarter the listed price if you book in advance and pay for them in 30-day blocks. Most lodgings are designed for Medium or Small creatures able to survive in the local environment; prices for unusually large tenants or those in need of special atmosphere or gravity conditions run up to 10 times as much. Most lodgings have free access to unsecured sections of the local infosphere and basic entertainment options.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Suite</h1>\n<p><strong>A suite forms a complete set of living quarters with multiple rooms, including a kitchen and full bathroom, plus laundry facilities either within the suite or available nearby.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Price&nbsp;10 per night per bed</strong></p>",
