Clothing is often worn both under and over armor, and its benefits apply in nearly all situations. Clothing comes in several varieties based upon its intended purpose, as described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Party clothes are usually designed for occasions where everyday or professional wear won&rsquo;t do but where formal wear is too fancy. Usually, party wear takes the form of special costumes or unusual dress that one must wear to avoid looking out of place at the engagement. Lacking the proper party wear at a social event can cause you to take a penalty of up to &ndash;4 to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Disguise checks at the function, as determined by the GM.</strong></p>",
