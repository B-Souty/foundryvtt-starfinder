      "value": "<h1>Lodgings</h1>\n<p>Lodging prices are given per night, but paying for longer periods in advance can reduce this price. In general, you can find accommodations at half to one-quarter the listed price if you book in advance and pay for them in 30-day blocks. Most lodgings are designed for Medium or Small creatures able to survive in the local environment; prices for unusually large tenants or those in need of special atmosphere or gravity conditions run up to 10 times as much. Most lodgings have free access to unsecured sections of the local infosphere and basic entertainment options.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A sleep pod has an area not much bigger than that of a bed, and is available as a stand-alone pod in a public area or as the smallest room or apartment available in a hotel or living complex. Frequently, 3&ndash;5 sleep pods are stacked atop each other in each section, and a hallway may have hundreds of such units. Showers and restroom facilities are often communal, and no allowance is made for cooking or cleaning.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Price&nbsp;1 per night</strong></p>",
