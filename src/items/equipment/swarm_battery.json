      "value": "<p>When weapon designers couldn&rsquo;t achieve an acceptable power output with their Swarm-based armaments, they created the&nbsp;Swarm battery, a new type of living power cell. Similar to the insulated gland of a generator drone, a&nbsp;Swarm battery&nbsp;consists of still-living tissue that reflexively adapts to power any item, including non-Swarm varieties, functioning as a high-capacity battery with 40 charges. A&nbsp;Swarm battery&nbsp;can adapt to be recharged at any charging station. It also recharges on its own at the rate of 1 charge per hour, provided it remains within 60 feet of ambient nearby electricity, such as power conduits in a city, a starship&rsquo;s power core, consistent static electricity, or even the small amount of electricity running through a living body.</p>",
