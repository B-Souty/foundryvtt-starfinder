      "value": "<h1>Grooming</h1>\n<p>Grooming practices vary widely from species to species, but all generally involve various methods to keep a creature&rsquo;s body neat and clean. Examples of standard grooming services include haircuts, fur trimming, feather preening, claw or nail trimming, nail and scale buffing, parasite removal, tooth cleaning and dentistry, and the like. Exotic grooming services are usually considered luxuries rather than necessities, and include hair, fur, or scale coloring; body modifications; permanent and temporary tattoos; and wellness services such as massages, medicinal baths, and spa treatments.</p>",
