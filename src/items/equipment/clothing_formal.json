Clothing is often worn both under and over armor, and its benefits apply in nearly all situations. Clothing comes in several varieties based upon its intended purpose, as described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Formal wear is designed for a specific social function, such as a wedding or funeral, and commonly differs from planet to planet and even from culture to culture. Lacking the proper formal wear at a social event can cause you to take a penalty of up to &ndash;4 to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Disguise checks at the function, as determined by the GM.</strong></p>",
