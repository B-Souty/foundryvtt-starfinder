      "value": "<h1>Recharging Stations</h1>\n<p>Most settlements of any significant size have public recharging stations for batteries and power cells. To recharge the full capacity of a spent battery or power cell takes 1 round per charge and costs half the price of the battery or cell. You can recharge a partially depleted battery or cell, but the price for doing so is the same as if it were fully spent. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, some larger starships might have onboard recharging stations. These might offer recharging at low or no cost, but they typically take 1 minute per charge to recharge a battery or power cell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 98.9475%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.3794%; text-align: center;\"><strong>Recharging Stations, 1 round/charge</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.3794%; text-align: center;\"><strong>1/2 price of battery or cell</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 0.35461%;\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
