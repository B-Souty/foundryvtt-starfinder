      "value": "<p>Gravitic-modulator technology was developed on Silselrik, derived from the selamids&rsquo; innate ability to withstand the stresses of changing gravity. Originally designed by the selamids for their own use when venturing away from the safety of their megadoplexes, these devices see common use among offworlders visiting Silselrik for commerce, research, or work in the diamond mines. While a selamid simply absorbs the device into its protoplasm, most humanoids wear the&nbsp;gravitic modulator&nbsp;as a backpack due to its size and weight.<br /><br />While wearing a&nbsp;gravitic modulator, you are shielded from some of the effects of rapidly changing gravity. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws to resist gravity-based effects, such as a&nbsp;control gravity&nbsp;spell or a solarian&rsquo;s black hole revelation. In addition, whenever you would take damage from extreme gravity, you take 5 less damage (minimum 0 damage).</p>",
