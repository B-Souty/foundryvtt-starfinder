In general, you can find accommodations at half to one-quarter the listed price if you book in advance and pay for them in 30-day blocks. Most lodgings are designed for Medium or Small creatures able to survive in the local environment; prices for unusually large tenants or those in need of special atmosphere or gravity conditions run up to 10 times as much. Most lodgings have free access to unsecured sections of the local infosphere and basic entertainment options.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>An efficiency is a small living quarters designed for one or two people, normally no bigger than 250&ndash;300 square feet.
