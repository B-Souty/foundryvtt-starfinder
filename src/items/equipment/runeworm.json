      "value": "<p><strong>WARNING: This entry contains spoilers for the Dead Sun Adventure Path.</strong><br />Currently interlaced with the skull and spine of one of Serovox&rsquo;s defeated foes, this hybrid item appears to be a 24-inch-long metallic centipede covered in runes. When it is placed near your ear (or a similar orifice), it animates and enters your body. Once inside you, the runeworm intertwines with your internal anatomy and releases an arcane virus that rewrites and improves some part of your body&rsquo;s function. It functions as a&nbsp;mk 2 synergizing symbiote, which is able to increase an ability score by 4. However, it is so advanced that it can instead upgrade any mk 2 personal upgrade already in your system to a mk 3 personal upgrade, increasing the ability score bonus from +4 to +6.</p>",
