      "value": "<h1>Ladder</h1>\n<p>Constructed from lightweight composites, a collapsible ladder consists of a telescoping frame with foldout rungs. As a move action, you can press a small button on the ladder&rsquo;s side to extend the ladder to its full length. Collapsing a ladder is a full action. Collapsible ladders come in three standard lengths at full extension: 10 feet, 20 feet, and 40 feet. The bulk values listed for collapsible ladders on Table 1&ndash;30 are for their collapsed state. When fully extended, a 10-foot ladder has 2 bulk, a 20-foot ladder has 3 bulk, and a 40-foot ladder has 5 bulk. A collapsible ladder cannot be used as a ladder when collapsed.</p>",
