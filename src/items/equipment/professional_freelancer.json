      "value": "<p>Entertainers, experts, porters, and tradesfolk often lack time or interest in taking jobs outside of their normal work. Those who do are freelancers, who build a circle of regular clients and get paid directly by those to whom they provide services.<br /><br />The price of hiring a freelancer is based on the typical total bonus she has in a specific relevant skill (often Profession), representing her skill level. However, the GM can determine a specific freelancer actually has a bonus much higher or lower than the norm for someone at her pay rate.<br /><br />Even professional freelancers won&rsquo;t generally take work that places them in serious danger, and those few who do are likely to insist on pay rates two to 10 times higher than those listed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Price&nbsp;Skill Bonus x 2 per day</strong></p>",
