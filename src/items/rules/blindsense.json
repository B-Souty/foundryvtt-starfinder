Blindsense operates out to a range specified in the creature&rsquo;s description.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">A creature with blindsense typically perceives using a specific sense, which is indicated in parentheses after the blindsense entry in the creature&rsquo;s statistics. If the indicated sense somehow becomes unusable&mdash;say, for example, if a creature that uses sound to perceive through its blindsense becomes deaf&mdash;the creature loses access entirely to its blindsense. The typical senses through which creatures with blindsense can perceive are emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, and vibration.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\">If you have the blindsense special ability and succeed at a Perception check to notice an unseen creature, you become aware of the creature&rsquo;s location. Blindsense negates the bonuses to Stealth checks that an unseen creature would otherwise receive, but unseen creatures still have total concealment against the attacks of creatures with blindsense, and creatures with blindsense are still flat-footed against the attacks of unseen creatures. See Dealing with Unseen Creatures on page 261 for more information.&nbsp;</span></p>",
