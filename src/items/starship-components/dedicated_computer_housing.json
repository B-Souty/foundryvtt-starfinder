      "value": "An expansion bay can be outfitted with power conduits and wires needed to house an additional mononode computer core (which must be purchased separately). This additional computer has an integrated control module (ICM) that is dedicated to a single starship combat crew action (for example, an engineerâ€™s checks to divert or a gunnerâ€™s check to fire at will), chosen when the computer is installed. The ICM grants its flat circumstance bonus once per round to the check for the chosen starship combat action. This bonus does not stack with the circumstance bonus granted by the main computerâ€™s ICM.",
