      "value": "<p>A biomechanical starship must usually be in proximity to a star to use its self-repair functions, but not so with a root system. A vessel that has a root system can instead attach to a planet, asteroid, or other astronomical body to acquire materials and energy for selfâ€‘repair. Larger ships can use a root system to carry such self-repair fuel with the craft. Such use of available material is usually enough for self-repair to function as normal, subject to GM discretion.</p>",
