      "value": "This expansion bay serves as a training facility and database for agents preparing to infiltrate a group or species. Clothing and personal items can be crafted in half the normal time at a cultural preparation facility, though the crafter must still provide the necessary raw materials. The facilityâ€™s computer system also trains personnel in the languages and accents, cultural behaviors, social norms, and even body language and facial expressions of the group the users expect to infiltrate. To use this aspect of a cultural preparation facility, a creature chooses a single species or cultural group and then spends three 8-hour sessions (which can be over the course of several days) within the facility. After this time, for 1 day, the creature has a +2 circumstance bonus on Culture checks relating to the chosen species or cultural group. In addition, the creature can replace one of the languages it knows (except for Common, their racial tongue, or the language of their home planet) with a language spoken by the chosen species or cultural group. At the GMâ€™s discretion, the cultural preparation facility might not be able to teach a rare or unusual language.",
