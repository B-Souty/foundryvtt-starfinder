      "value": "When properly reinforced to absorb the strain, an expansion bay along a starshipâ€™s aft or sides can house additional thrusters and fuel tanks (the thrusters must be purchased separately and be an appropriate size for the starship) as well as separate fuel tanks. During starship combat, the pilot can activate these additional thrusters before moving the starship during the helm phase as part of their crew action. When activated, the additional boosters increase the starshipâ€™s speed by an amount equal to the boostersâ€™ listed speed divided by 4 (rounded down) and increase the DC of Piloting checks to perform stunts that round by an equal amount. The boostersâ€™ supplemental fuel supply can power them for 5 rounds, after which the thrusters need 24 hours to recharge from the shipâ€™s power core. A starship can have only one such additional booster active at a time.",
