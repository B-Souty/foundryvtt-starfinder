      "value": "<p>A The following Expansion Bay is compatible only with a Supercolossal ship.</p>\n<p>A Drift booster is a rail for launching smaller ships into the Drift from within a Supercolossal vesselâ€™s hangar bay. A smaller ship that launches from within the Supercolossal vesselâ€™s hangar bay using the Drift booster can temporarily raise its Drift engine rating by 1. This increase lasts only as long as the smaller ship stays in the Drift and on the same course after launching using the Drift booster. If the boosted ship changes course or leaves the Drift, this temporary increase ends.</p>",
