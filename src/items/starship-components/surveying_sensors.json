      "value": "This room of specialized analytical equipment and sensory technology augments a starshipâ€™s sensors when scanning planetary bodies, spatial anomalies, debris, and similar phenomena. When scanning such targets, the science officer doubles the bonus to Computers checks granted by the starshipâ€™s sensors (maximum +8). The surveying sensors also double the range of the starshipâ€™s sensors to 500 feet while in atmosphere or on planets. The augmented sensors provide no special benefits during starship combat.",
