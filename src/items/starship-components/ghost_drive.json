      "value": "<p>A ghost drive can be installed only on a Large or smaller starship. During the helm phase, as a crew action, a science officer can attempt a Computers check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 Ã— the starshipâ€™s tier) to activate the ghost drive. If the check is successful, the ghost drive becomes active and the vessel in which it is installed becomes insubstantial.</p>\n<p>An active ghost drive has several effects in starship combat. The drive pulls power from the thrusters, so the insubstantial starshipâ€™s speed is 2 lower and its distance between turns is 1 higher. An insubstantial starship can move through hexes containing enemy starships without allowing those foes to make free attacks; conversely, the insubstantial starship canâ€™t make free attacks on ships that pass through its hex. The starshipâ€™s science officer can freely deactivate the ghost drive at the beginning of the helm phase; otherwise, the effect continues indefinitely.</p>",
