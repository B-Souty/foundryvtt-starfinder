      "value": "<p>A root system can be installed only in a biomechanical starship (Pact Worlds 152). A biomechanical starship must usually be in proximity to a star to use its self-repair functions, but a root system forgoes this requirement. A vessel that has a root system can instead attach to a planet, asteroid, or other astronomical body to acquire materials and energy for self-repair. Larger ships can use a root system to carry such self-repair fuel with the ship. Such use of available material is usually enough for self-repair to function as normal, subject to GM discretion.</p>",
