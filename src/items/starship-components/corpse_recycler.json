      "value": "A corpse recycler allows a starship crew to render bodies into With powerful computers and complex algorithms, starships are practically able to fly themselves. Yet for those hoping to optimize their starshipsâ€™ performance, there are countless technologies designed to help officers interface with and control their vessels, giving commands at the speed of thought.
