      "value": "ASmuggler compartments are cargo holds hidden behind false bulkheads and are shielded from most scanning, allowing a starship equipped with them to haul illegal goods without detection. A smuggler compartment can contain 10 tons of goods, with no item being larger than Medium. A creature on the starship must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to detect a basic smuggler compartment on the starship. A creature scanning the starship must succeed at a DC 20 Computers check to detect one (this additional check is part of the science officerâ€™s scan action in starship combat; see page 325). For each Build Point spent over the base cost, these DCs increase by 5 (maximum DC 50), though the amount of power the compartment uses also increases by 1.",
