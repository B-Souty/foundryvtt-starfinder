The additional mass and volume of external expansion bays reduce the starshipâ€™s maneuverability; increase the turn distance of a starship by 1 for every three external expansion bays it has, rounded up. External expansion bays can be installed only on a Small or larger starship, and the number of external expansion bays cannot exceed the number of expansion bays provided by the starshipâ€™s base frame.",
