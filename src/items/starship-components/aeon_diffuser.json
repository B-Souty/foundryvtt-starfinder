The diffuser conveys the benefits of an aeon stone placed inside it to all creatures aboard the starship. However, a starship that has biometric locks can limit the benefit of the <em>aeon diffuser</em> to only those creatures able to operate those locks. If the ship&rsquo;s life-support system is malfunctioning, the <em>aeon diffuser</em> ceases to convey its benefits. If the ship&rsquo;s life-support system is wrecked, any <em>aeon stone</em> within an <em>aeon diffuser</em> on the ship is destroyed.</span></p>",
