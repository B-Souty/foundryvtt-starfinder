      "value": "<p><b>Note:</b> The following Expansion Bay is compatible only with a Supercolossal ship.</p>\n<p>A tactical sensor tank (TST) allows a Supercolossal ship to coordinate the sensor readings of multiple escort craft into a unified picture of surrounding space and then share this information with each starship. Science officers can use a TST to link the sensors of any number of allied vessels in range of the TST-equipped shipâ€™s sensors. The sensor range for all linked ships extends as far as the farthest-reaching range among them, since the TST system collects data from linked vessels, correlates possible sensor targets, and sends that information to all linked ships.</p>",
