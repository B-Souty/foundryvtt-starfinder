As a full action, you can move up to your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative special property or with any small arm. Just before making your attack, attempt a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check (or a check associated with your specialization; see page 94) with a DC equal to 20 + your target&rsquo;s CR. If you succeed at the check, you deal 1d4 additional damage and the target is @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed} against your attack. This damage increases to 1d8 at 3rd level, to 3d8 at 5th level, and by an additional 1d8 every 2 levels thereafter. You can&rsquo;t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy special property or that requires a full action to make a single attack.</span></p>"
