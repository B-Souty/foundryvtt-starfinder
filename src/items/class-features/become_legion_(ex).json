This is a polymorph effect, and it counts against the number of arrays you can have active. While transformed, you&rsquo;re a Gargantuan construct with the swarm subtype, a space of 20 feet, and a reach of 0 feet. You can occupy the same space as other creatures. As a standard action, you can make a swarm attack (1d4 piercing damage per 2 nanocyte levels) and gain swarm defenses (except immunity to single-target mind-affecting effects) and swarm immunities as per the universal creature rules (</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Starfinder Alien Archive </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">157). These immunities don&rsquo;t end ongoing conditions. When dealing swarm damage to creatures in your space, you can avoid damaging a number of creatures up to your Constitution modifier.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This transformation lasts until the beginning of your next turn, at which point you can attempt a DC 30 Fortitude saving throw. If you succeed, the transformation&rsquo;s duration extends to the beginning of your next turn. If you fail, the transformation ends, and you re-form in any space your swarm body occupied. The DC of this saving throw increases by 2 each time you succeed at the saving throw. If you&rsquo;re reduced to 0 Hit Points, the transformation ends automatically.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can&rsquo;t use this knack again until after you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.</span></p>",
