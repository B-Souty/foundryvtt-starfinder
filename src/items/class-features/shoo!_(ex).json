If you succeed, the target must also succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your envoy level + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened for 1 round or until it takes an action to move away from you. Once a creature has been affected by this ability, it&rsquo;s immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to target multiple creatures with the animal or vermin creature type with this ability, up to a maximum number of creatures equal to half your envoy level. Attempt one Intimidate check against all your selected targets. The DC of the check is equal to the highest DC to demoralize any one of the foes, plus 1 for each additional target beyond the first.</p>",
