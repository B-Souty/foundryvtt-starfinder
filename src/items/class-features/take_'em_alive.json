To use this ability, you must be within 60 feet of both an ally and your ally&rsquo;s target, the latter which must have taken damage from a nonlethal attack within the last minute. If your ally would reduce the target to 0 HP&mdash;and the attack doesn&rsquo;t deal damage that equals or exceeds half the target&rsquo;s maximum Hit Points&mdash;then, as a reaction, you can have the target merely fall unconscious from the attack as though the attack had dealt nonlethal damage.</p>",
