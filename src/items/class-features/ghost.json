As a full action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to phase through up to 5 feet of solid matter. If you attempt to phase through something that is too thick, you spend the Resolve Point and take the action but the attempt fails. You cannot phase through force effects such as force fields or the barrier created by <em>wall of force</em>. After using phase shift escape, you can&rsquo;t use it again until after you&rsquo;ve taken a full 8-hour rest.</span></p>"
