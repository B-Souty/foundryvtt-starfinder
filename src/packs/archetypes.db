Once per minute as a reaction to when your ward is adjacent to you and would take damage, you can expend 1 Resolve Point and grant your ward DR 10/&mdash; or resistance 10 against one energy damage type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). This damage reduction or resistance is applicable only against the triggering attack and ends as soon as the damage from the triggering attack is resolved.</p>\n<p>At 18th level, the amount of damage reduction or energy resistance this class feature grants increases to 15.</p>\n<h2>Traceless Persona (Ex) - 18th Level</h2>\n<p>You are exceptional at masking your digital and physical appearance, and you can help your ward to do the same. Once per day, you can take 20 on an attempt to use Computers to create or detect a forgery. Anyone attempting to use Computers to track the digital signature of you or your ward (if you have designated one using your abolitionist aegis class feature) must roll twice and use the lowest result when doing so.</p>\n<p>This feature provides a number of other benefits. The DC for another creature to find or follow your tracks is 20 + 1-1/2 &times; your ranks in Stealth or Survival (your choice), no matter what circumstances, surfaces, or conditions you travel in. If you mask or cover allies&rsquo; tracks, taking at least a full action to do so, this DC also applies to checks to find or follow those tracks. In addition, when you attempt a Disguise check to change your appearance, you can affect yourself and up to six allies. When you attempt to change your appearance and that of your allies, you can ignore DC modifiers for altering major features, being disguised as a different race of the same creature type, and being disguised as a different creature type.</p>","unidentified":""},"source":"COM pg. 97","type":"","modifiers":[],"grants":{"levels":[]},"requirements":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_id":"cx2nuBSt2P5zF3Uw"}
{"name":"Doshko Specialist","type":"archetypes","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","value":"<p>A doshko is as much a symbol as it is a weapon. The traditional vesk melee weapon, a doshko requires strength to wield and delivers devastating blows in the right hands. The weapon imparts a clear willingness to engage in bloody conflict, which is why fearsome groups like the church of Damoritosh intentionally rely on doshko iconography. Doshko specialists are martial artists who study the history and traditions of the doshko not only to improve their ability to vanquish foes in melee, but to learn lessons of honor and fury that the weapon&rsquo;s legacy can teach.</p>\n<p>Nearly everyone familiar with an arms dealer&rsquo;s wares knows that doshkos come with anywhere from one to four axe-like blades made of steel or energy, though the three-bladed version is the most common. Few other than vesk martial historians&mdash; including doshko specialists&mdash;understand that each blade has a specific meaning. Doshko specialists call the weapons&rsquo; blades their &ldquo;teeth,&rdquo; and each tooth, from the tip down to the haft, must be earned, one at a time, by learning a specific truth about the weapon. Although anyone might purchase a doshko with a variable number of blades, doshko specialists prefer to limit themselves to doshkos with only the number of blades they have earned. Intense rivalries ignite when doshko specialists find themselves on opposite sides of a confrontation.</p>\n<p>Most doshko specialists are solarians, soldiers, or vanguards. Such soldiers often have the blitz fighting style, while vanguards might have the cascade or momentum aspects. Many doshko specialists are vesk, although vesk usually appreciate those of other species who strive to embrace the power and legacy of their traditional weapon.</p>\n<h1>Prerequisites</h1>\n<p>You must be proficient with advanced melee weapons, such as from the proficiency granted by a class, a class feature, or the Advanced Melee Weapons Proficiency feat. This proficiency imparts a prospective doshko specialist the honor of bearing a doshko with a single blade, which they call the Tooth of Eager Spirit.</p>\n<p>If you are a solarian using a solar weapon and choose a doshko for its general design, you can apply the effects of this archetype to your solar weapon as though it were a doshko, as long as it remains as that design.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Class Features</h1>\n<p>The doshko specialist archetype grants additional class features at 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. Effects that apply to a doshko you are holding end as soon as you aren&rsquo;t holding it.</p>\n<h2>Tooth That Seeks Honor (Ex) - 2nd Level</h2>\n<p>The second doshko tooth resists dishonor. Your training empowers you to recover from missed blows by extending your reach or changing tactics. When you miss an opponent with a melee attack with your doshko, you can grant that doshko the disarm, reach, sunder, or trip weapon special property until the start of your next turn. If you miss again before the start of your next turn, you can grant the doshko an additional special property from the list. You can grant a doshko only two special properties at a time with this ability.</p>\n<h2>Tooth That Bites Steel (Ex) - 6th Level</h2>\n<p>The third tooth strives to prove the doshko a superior weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls when performing disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuvers with a doshko. If your attack roll is a natural 20, you also apply the doshko&rsquo;s critical hit effect (if any) to the target.</p>\n<h2>Tooth That Reaps the Unworthy (Ex) - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>The fourth tooth tears flesh. A doshko you hold that does not have the wound or severe wound critical hit effect gains the effects of the wounding weapon fusion. When you score a critical hit with a doshko with the wound or severe wound critical hit effect, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to choose the next-highest result from the Wounding Weapons table after rolling. When you score a critical hit with a doshko with the severe wound critical hit effect, you also increase the DC to save against it by 2.</p>\n<h2>Tooth That Commands Terror (Su) - 18th Level</h2>\n<p>You have earned the right to bear the celebrated fiveâ€‘bladed doshko. Any doshko you hold manifests five blades, magically sprouting additional blades of steel or energy as needed. While you hold a doshko, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to saves against fear effects and you gain the frightful presence universal creature rule with a range of 60 feet and a duration of 2d4 rounds. The DC for this effect is 10 + half your base attack bonus + your Strength modifier.</p>","unidentified":""},"source":"","type":"","modifiers":[],"grants":{"levels":[]},"requirements":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"effects":[],"sort":0,"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"sf","system":"sfrpg","coreVersion":"0.8.8","systemVersion":"0.12.0"}},"_id":"h38CBZmv09VOabyR"}
{"name":"Assassin","type":"archetypes","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":{"chat":"","gmnotes":"","short":"","value":"<p>Throughout the galaxy, shadowy figures move unseen, expertly eliminating targets before disappearing back into anonymity. Assassins originate from many different home worlds and cultures, and while no single tradition defines these gifted killers, several secretive societies train accomplished warriors into finely honed tools of discreet murder. Others learn the deadly craft on their own or from a mentor, refining their skills through decades of mercenary work. Some see assassins as supernatural beings&mdash;avatars of death that employ reality-bending magic to eliminate their targets. Others maintain that assassins gain their edge via superior technology. In truth, assassins make use of all manner of tactics, and some even use technomagical methods. Many organizations court assassins with exorbitant salaries and promises of immunity.</p>\n<p>While many of the galaxy&rsquo;s denizens are capable of committing murderous acts, assassins regard death as a painter does a palette. A skilled assassin can observe a target and determine the precise moment to strike, dealing irreparable damage to the target&rsquo;s vital organs and ending their life with a single lethal blow. Many assassins also employ magic capable of tampering with the memories of potential witnesses, while others deploy technology that obscures their presence from modern surveillance.</p>\n<p>Assassins value anonymity and discretion above all else; leaving a fragment of security footage behind or allowing their identity to be discovered can cost an assassin their job, if not their life. Many operatives and soldiers seek training as an assassin, but anyone with a talent for stealth and the willingness to kill can become an assassin. Though murder is part of the job description, not all assassins have evil alignments. Some individuals with this specialized training use their talents to serve a higher cause, but many are hardened criminals or jaded veterans with too much blood on their hands. Rumor has it that some law enforcement agencies in the galaxy employ small units of assassins responsible for tracking and taking down high-risk criminal targets.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Class Features</h1>\n<p>The assassin archetype grants alternate class features at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<h2>Opportunistic Cloaking (Ex) - 6th Level</h2>\n<p>You know how to manipulate your environment and take advantage of gaps in others&rsquo; perception to become undetectable even in plain sight. Once per day, you can attempt a Stealth check to hide as though you had succeeded at the create a diversion task of the Bluff skill against up to six creatures you&rsquo;re observing. This ability functions only in crowded areas or in dim light or darkness; the GM might determine you can use this ability in similar circumstances.</p>\n<h2>Lethal Strike (Ex) - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you can study the weaknesses of a single enemy that you&rsquo;re observing. Once per day, on a round after you spend 2 consecutive rounds studying the same enemy this way, you can either take a full action to move up to your speed and make a single attack with a melee weapon, or take a full action to attack with a sniper weapon (using the sniper weapon&rsquo;s sniper range if applicable), against the studied enemy. This lethal strike attack deals damage as normal, and the target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your key ability modifier) or take 1d6 additional damage per your character level. If the target fails the save, it must also attempt a second Fortitude saving throw with the same DC. If it fails this second save, it dies instantly; this is a death effect.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever you kill a creature using your lethal strike, you can attempt a Stealth check opposed by Perception checks to notice by those in the vicinity; if successful, you prevent those nearby from identifying you as the attacker. If you succeed by 5 or more, bystanders might not even immediately notice that the target is dead (at the GM&rsquo;s discretion).</p>\n<h2>Exploitative Strike (Ex) - 18th Level</h2>\n<p>When you use lethal strike, you can force your target to roll its initial save twice and take the worse result. Alternatively, when a target that you studied on your previous turn is within your reach and an ally&rsquo;s attack results in a critical hit against it, you can activate lethal strike as a reaction.</p>","unidentified":""},"source":"NS pg. 143","type":"","modifiers":[],"grants":{"levels":[]},"requirements":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"effects":[],"sort":0,"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"sf","system":"sfrpg","coreVersion":"0.8.8","systemVersion":"0.12.0"}},"_id":"no4B1XS1IAIeFWnl"}
