      "value": "<p><strong>WARNING: This entry contains spoilers for the Dead Sun Adventure Path.</strong><br />Serovox pried this pair of pale sapphire gems from the head of an inevitable they destroyed in a duel. When you hold one of the eyes in one hand, you can control the other as a spy drone that can&rsquo;t be upgraded. You see what the flying eye sees through the eye you hold. However, if you place the gems over your own eyes, they burrow into your skull and replace two of your eyes (destroying the optic nerves of any additional eyes if you have more than two eyes), functioning as a long-range darkvision capacitors augmentation. You can still send out one eye as a spy drone, during which time the eyes do not grant you darkvision. When the eyes aren&rsquo;t embedded in a skull and aren&rsquo;t in use, a reddish mist slowly coalesces around them.</p>",
